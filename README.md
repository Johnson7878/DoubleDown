# NumMy by Team DoubleDown (88)
## Project Description
NumMy is a math game developed on Eclipse using java and the swing framework. The main purpose of the game is to help K-12 students develop stronger math skills. This is accomplished by having a difficulty system generate questions according to a userâ€™s difficulty setting. As a user gets more questions correct, the difficulty of the game will increase. To incentivize playing the game, a profile system is in place so users can track their progress and compete with different users.
